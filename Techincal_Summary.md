# Technical Summary

## Architecture and Tech Stack Decisions

The Docreader project is designed as a full-stack application, consisting of an Angular frontend and a Node.js backend. The frontend, built with Angular 20, provides a modern, responsive user interface for uploading and interacting with PDF documents. The backend, implemented in Node.js with Express, handles file uploads, PDF parsing, and communication with AI services for document analysis.

**Frontend:**

- Angular was chosen for its robust ecosystem, strong TypeScript support, and ease of building scalable, maintainable SPAs.
- The use of Angular CLI streamlines development, testing, and building processes.

**Backend:**

- Node.js with Express offers a lightweight, efficient server for handling HTTP requests and file uploads.
- Libraries such as `pdf-parse` enable efficient PDF extraction
- Integration with the Gemini AI API (or similar) allows for advanced document analysis and summarization.

**Containerization:**

- Docker is used to ensure consistent environments across development and production, simplifying deployment and dependency management.
- Docker Compose orchestrates the multi-container setup, allowing both frontend and backend to be started with a single command.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. Docker Image Build Errors

One of the main challenges was building reliable Docker images for both the frontend and backend. Early attempts resulted in errors related to missing dependencies, incorrect working directories, and port conflicts. To resolve these:

- I carefully reviewed and updated the Dockerfiles, ensuring all necessary dependencies were installed and the correct build context was set.
- Explicitly exposed the required ports and set up environment variables in the docker-compose files.
- Used multi-stage builds for the Angular frontend to optimize image size and performance.

### 2. Environment Variable Management

Managing sensitive API keys (like `GEMINI_API_KEY`) securely was another challenge. Initially, there was confusion about where to set these variables for both local and Dockerized environments. The solution involved:

- Documenting the use of `.env` files for local development.
- Ensuring docker-compose files reference environment variables and do not hardcode secrets.
- Adding clear instructions in the README files to guide future developers.

### 3. AI Model Selection and Integration

Understanding which AI model to use for document analysis required research and experimentation. The Gemini API was selected for its capabilities in text extraction and summarization. Integrating the API involved:

- Reading documentation and testing endpoints with sample data.
- Handling API errors gracefully and providing meaningful feedback to the frontend.
- Abstracting the AI integration in the backend to allow for future model swaps if needed.

## Potential Improvements

With more time, I would focus on:

- **Testing:** Adding comprehensive unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend to ensure reliability and catch regressions early.
- **Security:** Implementing authentication and authorization, especially if the app is to be deployed publicly.
- **Scalability:** Refactoring the backend to support horizontal scaling and adding caching for repeated document analyses.
- **User Experience:** Enhancing the frontend with progress indicators, better error handling, and more intuitive document navigation.
- **CI/CD:** Setting up automated pipelines for testing, building, and deploying the application.

## Development Experience Reflection

This project was a valuable learning experience in full-stack development, containerization, and AI integration. The process of troubleshooting Docker issues deepened my understanding of container workflows and best practices. Integrating with an external AI API required careful reading of documentation and iterative testing, which improved my skills in API consumption and error handling.

Overall, the exercise reinforced the importance of clear documentation, modular architecture, and proactive problem-solving. If given more time, I would continue to refine the codebase, automate more processes, and explore additional AI capabilities to further enhance the application's value.
